Read and write raster and vector geospatial datasets straight from [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) with this native asynchrounous [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) binding. To get started, browse the [**API Documentation**](https://contra.io/node-gdal-next/classes/gdal.html) or [examples](examples/).

# Fork Notes

This project is a fork of <https://github.com/contra/node-gdal-next> which is a fork of <https://github.com/naturalatlas/node-gdal>.

It adds a number of features, the main one being asynchronous operations.

- **Support for asynchronous IO**

Async support for vector data is currently experimental, with the following classses being async-compatible on `master`
* main `open`
* global `Algorithms`
* `Dataset`
* `DatasetBands`
* `DatasetLayers`
* `Driver`
* `Geometry`
* `RasterBandPixels`
* `LayerFeatures`

`master` is usually unit-tested and has all the working features
`universal-async` is cutting edge for the vector async support
`vsimem` has support for in-memory files - `gdal.open` supports opening a `Buffer`

Support for `worker_threads` is planned but it is not a priority project

### Breaking Changes relative to node-gdal

- With PROJ 6+, the order of coordinates for EPSG geographic coordinate reference systems is latitude first,
longitude second. If you don't want to make large code changes, you can replace code like `gdal.SpatialReference.fromEPSG(4326)` with `gdal.SpatialReference.fromProj4('+init=epsg:4326')`

### Breaking Changes relative to node-gdal-next

- None, node-gdal-next is usually kept in sync

## Installation

Pre-built binaries are provided for most recent Linux distributions, Windows 64 bit and OS X 10.15:

```sh
npm install gdal-async
```

By default all dependencies are the latest versions and bundled out of the box, but if you would like to link against a pre-installed gdal you will have to rebuild it when installing using the following flags:

```sh
# --shared_gdal allows linking to the OS-provided libgdal, requires libgdal-dev (debian: sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev)
$ npm install gdal-next --build-from-source --shared_gdal  
```

## Sample Usage

### Synchronous

#### Raster

```js
const gdal = require("gdal-next")
const dataset = gdal.open("sample.tif")

console.log("number of bands: " + dataset.bands.count())
console.log("width: " + dataset.rasterSize.x)
console.log("height: " + dataset.rasterSize.y)
console.log("geotransform: " + dataset.geoTransform)
console.log("srs: " + (dataset.srs ? dataset.srs.toWKT() : 'null'))
```

#### Vector

```js
const gdal = require("gdal-next")
const dataset = gdal.open("sample.shp")
const layer = dataset.layers.get(0)

console.log("number of features: " + layer.features.count())
console.log("fields: " + layer.fields.getNames())
console.log("extent: " + JSON.stringify(layer.extent))
console.log("srs: " + (layer.srs ? layer.srs.toWKT() : 'null'))
```

### Asynchronous

Mixing of synchronous and asynchronous operations is supported.

#### Safe mixing of asynchronous operations

Simultaneous operations on distinct dataset objects are always safe and can run it parallel.
Simultaneous operations on the same dataset object should be safe too but they won't run in parallel. This is a limitation of GDAL. The only way to have multiple parallel operations on the same file is to use multiple dataset objects. Keep in mind that Node/libuv won't be able to detect which async contexts are waiting on each other, so if you launch 16 simultaneous operations on 4 different datasets, there is always a chance that libuv will pick up 4 operations on the same dataset to run - which will take all 4 slots on the thread pool. It is recommended to either increase `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` or to make sure that every dataset has exactly one operation running at any given time.

**Does not support `worker_threads` yet**

#### With callbacks

If the last argument of an `xxxAsync` function is a callback,
it will be called on completion with standard *(e,r)* semantics

In this case the function will return a resolved *Promise*
```js
const gdal = require('../node-gdal-async') // Or where it is installed
gdal.openAsync('sample.tif', (e, dataset) => {
    dataset.bands.get(1).pixels.readAsync(0, 0, dataset.rasterSize.x,
        dataset.rasterSize.y, (e, data) => {
        if (e) {
            console.error(e);
            return;
        }
        console.log(data);
    });
});
```

#### With promises

If there is no callback, the function will return a *Promise*

```js
gdal.openAsync('sample.tif').then((dataset) => {
    dataset.bands.get(1).pixels.readAsync(0, 0, dataset.rasterSize.x, dataset.rasterSize.y)
        .then((data) => {
            console.log(data);
        }).catch(e => console.error(e));
}).catch(e => console.error(e));
```
